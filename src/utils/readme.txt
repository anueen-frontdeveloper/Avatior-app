how we crash game ?

we need totalbet ammount - 1000
we need user cashout - 200


total pending Rs 800

getCrashPoint is connected to the flew plane. It chooses when the game will crash.

On the home screen, there is a  called chance, used by getWeightedMultiplier().

getWeightedMultiplier() makes the odds for crash point. It links home screen to how multiplier works in game.
